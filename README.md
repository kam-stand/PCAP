# PCAP command line tool and library 

a command line tool and library that can be used to extract and analyze .pcap file similar to wireshark and tcpdump

# Utility

1. read in pcap file and provide generic way to get all packet data 
2. provide reasonable layout to view and inspect packet data similar to [wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/)


# Information

When reading on ethernet frames and different link types. its important to note we are monstly reading data that is being transmitted from physical wires or wireless communication. In a `.pcap` file we are capturing from the end of this transmission into a computer. Hence, the preamble and  sfd are not present :alien:

# Diagrams

certain network protocols come with different formats. The following diagrams provide a visual to certain formats

‚ùó The format for a IEEE 802.3 Link type can be summarized in both as a data link and logical link header. The following [link](https://www.firewall.cx/networking/ethernet/ieee-8023-frame.html) showcases this. Furthermore, the diagram 
below shows the different way to interpret the actual payload
